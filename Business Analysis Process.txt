Business Analysis Process

For any Business Analyst the biggest challenge after getting a project is, how to start and from where to start the project? Or what deliverables might be creating and how to complete the project successfully?

Below are step by step some of the key techniques from the day 1 business analysis process till the end of the planning stage.

Step 1) - Gather all information about the project
It is business analyst's responsibility to gather all the details related to the project. By asking questions to people connected with the project (project manager, project sponsor, manager or business owner).

The information gathered should cover these topics

Project scope and boundaries
Current factors influencing the organization
Project risk and constraints
Broader organizational context
Stakeholders that are actively involved in it. This would be a good time to conduct Stakeholder Needs Analysis

After gathering all this information, analyze your part in the project and make a checklist that as a Business analyst you can include like

From your previous experience what you can implement in your current project
Documentation and planning required into the current project
Discussing the possible outcome of the project with stakeholders
Sort out the members that are involved in the project
Look for any help from client - fixing a meeting with the stakeholders
What are the expected deliverable and in what format it is required
What existing documentation you can review for better project idea
Find out what methodology (Agile or Waterfall) will be appropriate for your project


Step 2) Set up a review meeting with Project manager/ Stakeholder/ Team members
An unclear agenda may lead to a failure of the project.

Be specific in what is expected out of the project.
Involve Project manager/ Stakeholder/ Team members in meeting and ask questions related to project
It is very likely that you might be working on completely new project, in that case, ask project manager or contact person who has worked in that domain before
Step 3) Analyze all the project relevant documents like
Business process documentation
Business and system requirements documents
Business cases
Charts and flow diagrams
Project plans
Organization chart
Strategy documents and business plans
Policies and legislation
Uncover the information hidden in business requirement document and trace out any gaps with current systems, processes, procedures and operations. It is possible that document that is provided to you is out of date, so validate the information that you discover.

Step 4) Record all the facts and information that you discover
From your research and analysis, you may discover many useful information relevant to the project that has to be changed or implemented in the project. Record them.

Business requirements including reporting requirements
Business processes and supporting systems
Functional and non-functional requirements
Issues and risks that are currently influencing the project

Step 5) Understanding the problem domain
By now you will have a good insight of the project, now you can identify the problem domain in the project. You need to find out

Exactly which business function will be affected
Risks and factors affecting the business
Policies and constraints that influence the project
Values that determines the level of importance of the project
System currently supports the business activities
Document giving brief about the problem domain- e.g., Annual Report
Issues currently blocking the business to achieve the desired outcomes
On proposed change does it make any difference to problem domain

Step 6) Presenting your Business Requirement
Once you have gather all your business requirement and understand the problem domain. The next step is presenting your Business Requirement to Stakeholders or Project Manager. There are numerous techniques which can be used for presenting requirement like
