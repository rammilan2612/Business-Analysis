Role of BA in SDLC
Evaluation Phase
This phase is sometimes called the Initiation Stage but essentially, this is where the cycle starts. An idea or concept is evaluated and a proposal is put forward.
The more senior business analysts tend to get involved during this stage where the business need or business problem is evaluated at a very high level. You business analyst role here could include:
•	Developing a Concept Statement
•	Perform a Feasibility Study
•	Prepare an Options Analysis
•	Prepare an Impact Analysis
•	Prepare a Cost Benefit Analysis
Analysis Phase
During the Analysis Phase most of the typical business analysis requirements related activities take place.
You will be heavily involved in:
•	Requirements Gathering – Workshop Facilitation, Interviews, Observation, Research
•	Requirements Documentation – Business Requirements document, Requirements Traceability document, Functional & Non Functional Requirements documents
•	This is where you will also use your modelling skills to document business requirements.
•	Requirements Validation & Prioritization activities
•	Stakeholder Engagement
Design Phase
The Design Phase is when your requirements are being interpreted by the solution design teams / evaluated by the software vendors. You role here is typically to:
•	Review the solution documents
•	Work closely with solution designer and architects to ensure requirements are clear
•	Keep the stakeholder engaged to reassure them their requirements are implemented as specified in the business requirement artefacts.
•	Manage the changes to requirements both from the business and from your solution designerís point of view through a change control process. It is a great time to actively start using the Requirements Traceability Matrix!
Implementation Phase
In small teams it can happen that the BA is asked to clarify requirements or in Agile projects the BA will be asked to review prototypes.
Testing Phase
During the testing phase the Business Analyst can assist with reviewing test scripts to ensure all functional requirements are being tested. The role of a Business Analyst is not to actually execute the testing! Testers do that.
