Segmentation refers to the act of segmenting data according to your company’s needs in order to refine your analyses based on a defined context, using a tool for cross-calculating analyses. The purpose of segmentation is to better understand your visitors, and to obtain actionable data in order to improve your website or mobile app. In concrete terms, a segment enables you to filter your analyses based on certain elements (single or combined). Segmentation can be done on elements related to a visit, as well as on elements related to multiple visits during a studied period. In the latter case, we refer to this segmentation as “visitor segmentation”.

A few examples of possible segments: 

Visits originating only from direct traffic, and made using the Firefox browser ; 
The precise population of visitors who generate high (or low) revenue ;
Visits which started out on your site’s home page ;
Visitors who remained on your site for longer than 2 minutes.
